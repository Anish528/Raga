# Raga
A Music creation app based on the emotions provided.

We present Rāga, a model that creates high-fidelity music based on text descriptions like "a soothing violin melody supported by a distorted guitar riff." Rāga makes music at 24 kHz that holds steady for several minutes by modeling the process of conditional music synthesis as a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence modeling problem. Our tests demonstrate that Rāga works better than earlier systems in terms of both audio quality and fidelity to the written description. Additionally, we show that Rāga can be conditioned on both text and a melody by showing how it can change whistled and hummed melodies to match a text caption's description of that style. To aid future study, we openly share Rāga caps, a dataset of 5.5k music-text pairs with rich text descriptions from human subject-matter experts.
